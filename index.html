        I am a undergrad robotics researcher driven by the goal of creating intelligent systems that bridge the gap between human perception and machine efficiency. My journey into robotics began with a simple question: how can we make machines safer and more effective in handling labor-intensive, hazardous tasks while addressing their limitations in perception and adaptability? This curiosity has shaped my academic and professional pursuits.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in//" target="_blank">Robotics Research Center</a>, IIIT Hyderabad, I had the opportunity to work under the guidance of <a href="https://nagamanigi.wixsite.com/home" target="_blank">Prof. 
          Nagamanikandan Govindan</a>, exploring imitation learning to develop systems capable of operating effectively in real-world environments. I'm currently working under the guidance of <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/" target="_blank">Prof. Madhava Krishna</a>

        With a strong interest in combining physics-based principles and learning-based approaches, my work is focused on pushing the boundaries of what robots can achieve in complex environments. Apart from this I'm involved in a project with <a href="https://mattlisondra.com/" target="_blank"> Matthew Lisondra, PhD UofT</a> focussed on solving high dimensional data issues in manipulation. Working on addressing the challenge of deepfake detection by analyzing images generated from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm always eager to discuss new possibilities in the field. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahesh-reddy-tapeti/" target="_blank">linkedin</a>!
