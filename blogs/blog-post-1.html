            <p>Three months into working in corporate well, startups really and it’s been nothing short of a rollercoaster. It was a whole lot of fun. Every day I woke up to a new kind of problem at work. Things that worked earlier suddenly stopped working. Even though I spent most of my undergrad working on similar problems, these felt more challenging. Even a simple CNN classifier made me question myself. One thing became clear: the real world is so uncertain.</p>

            <p>I once forgot to fix <code>random.seed</code> and spent an hour scratching my head thinking, “Why the hell is this not reproducing?” Most of my time went into asking, “Do classical methods even work, or did I mess something up?” I would stare at the screen for hours analyzing how each attribute changed from the previous iteration. Why is the loss going down so quickly? Is the data that good? Or the model? Or is something wrong?</p>

            <p>This is a very unstructured blog, just trying to record everything I felt and experienced over this period. I hope it gives some intuition to someone looking to join a similar role. This isn’t a blog of problems, but a rough dictionary of how things actually work.</p>

            <p>All these years, many people thought writing code was the hard part, but I think it’s time to rethink that. Engineering it to work is the real challenge. These days, with all the great LLMs out there, your code can be clean and syntactically correct. But the real question is: what makes it work? Problem-solving skills are the key. I can write a good model architecture, sure, but does it work for my data? Say it performs well, great. But is it really working, or just overfitting? Does my data have enough variance? These are the actual building blocks of machine learning.</p>

            <p>I was recently working on a problem where I had to predict the trajectory of an object thrown into space. The straightforward approach was to take a recurrent neural network, feed it the first few time steps T, and roll out predictions for T + t. And yes, it worked. But real-world complications came in. If I had to use global coordinates, every object thrown needed a motion capture pin attached. That drove costs up. So, a better way? Maybe use some tracker to follow the object and feed that into the model. That worked too, but the inference time became the sum of “model to track” + “prediction model”—too much if you understand robotics.</p>

            <p>A simpler solution was to use 3D CNNs. Take range maps of the incoming object and predict future range maps. Lower inference time, no two-step tracking and prediction process. Did it work? Partially. The data didn’t have enough variance, so the model didn’t even converge, not even to overfit. Why? Maybe models learn better with more variation. One thing was clear: writing a recurrent neural net or 3D CNN wasn’t the key. It was figuring out what works better, why it works, why it doesn’t, how the data should be, what the compute time is, and what frequency it should run at.</p>

            <p>This is how things work in practice. Someone might spend months just tuning parameters to get the model to perform better than random. Earlier, I’d tuned to improve from 80% to 85%. Now, with real-world data, I’m happy if it just performs better than chance, maybe above 50% for a binary classifier.</p>

            <p>When it comes to visual odometry or SLAM, the go-to approach is SIFT or ORB with KITTI. And yeah, that works for KITTI. But step outside that dataset, go to an area with little structure, and it all falls apart. Then what? Use a transformer? A graph neural network? Sure, it might work for VO. But what about computation time and power constraints? Not practical in most real robotics applications.</p>

            <p>Honestly, the process of matching features is like playing test cricket, where Jimmy Anderson keeps bowling to your head. Whatever you try, there’s still a problem. It works under good lighting conditions, but not when it’s rainy. SIFT doesn’t even handle seasonal changes well. Days pass by asking, “Did SIFT match features at a 0.45 threshold?” </p>
            
            <p>I think more than the technical knowledge or engineering skills, what changed for me was how I structure my code to maximize experimentation. I now maintain a bunch of Jupyter notebooks to understand each of the, log even the simplest outputs, and plot every relevant attribute. Beyond the improvement in results, this method has significantly enhanced my way of thinking and, more importantly, sharpened my intuition. Honestly, discussing this process in detail could be an entire blog post on its own lol. The only way to get things to work is to analyze every bit of the result. If it takes days, so be it. That kind of deep analysis—understanding exactly what changed—is what gets you closer to a solution.</p>
            
            <p>Thanks for giving a read, lot more to come!!</p>
